_Diuretic_ provides typeclass instances for
[Anticipation](https://github.com/propensive/anticipation/) typeclasses for the
Java Standard Library. Many of these types have better alternatives in the
[Scala One](https://github.com/propensive/one/) ecosystem, but there are times
when it is necessary to work with types from the Java Standard Library.
