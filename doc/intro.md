Caching provides a useful tradeoff between the costs of _time_ and _space_; that is, a cache can reduce the
amount of computation time at the expense of using more memory. _Camouflage_ provides one implementation of a
cache which will be appropriate for some (but not all) applications: a least-recently-used cache, or LRU cache.
