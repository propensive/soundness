# Urticose

__Typesafe representations of network concepts__

We need to work with a variety of different types of entity when working with
networking technologies. These include URLs, IP addresses, email address and
MAC addresses. Parsing and serializing these entities without loss of
generality is typically nontrivial, and it is for this reason that __Urticose__
exists.

## Features

- Represent URLs, MAC addresses and IP addresses with immutable datatypes
- IPv4 addresses and MAC addresses are represented efficiently as opaque primitives
- Compile-time parsing of URLs, MAC addresses and IP addresses with string interpolators
- Runtime parsing and serialization, with parsing errors handled using capabilities


## Availability







## Getting Started

### Entity types

Urticose is capable of representing all of the following:
- IPv4 addresses as `Ipv4`s
- IPv6 addresses as `Ipv6`s
- URLs as `Url`s
- hostnames as `Hostname`s
- MAC addresses as `MacAddress`s

Email addresses will be added later.

### IP Addresses

#### Construction

To create an IP address value, either an `Ipv4` or `Ipv6`, from a known string, such as `192.168.1.12`
or `2000:abcd:1234::5:12`, simply write it inside quotes prefixed with `ip`, like so:
```scala
val address1: Ipv4 = ip"192.168.1.12"
val address2: Ipv6 = ip"2000:abcd:1234::5:12"
```

The same `ip` interpolator is used for both types, and the return type will adapt to the content.

A mistake in the content will result in a compile error, for example `ip"192.168.1.2.3"` will fail to
compile because there are five `.`-separated integers, rather than four.

In particular, for IPv4 addresses, the parser checks for,
 - exactly four groups
 - only integers in the range 0-255
 - no non-integer characters, other than `.`

and for IPv6 addresses,
 - a maximum of eight `:`-separated groups
 - at most one `::` separator
 - between one and four hexadecimal characters for each group

#### Parsing

The same parser can be used at runtime, throwing an `IpAddressError` in the event of an incorrect address.

To parse an IP address from a `Text` value, use the `parse` method of either the `Ipv4` or `Ipv6` objects,
for example,
```scala
val address1: Ipv4 = Ipv4.parse(t"192.168.1.12")
val address2: Ipv6 = Ipv6.parse(ipAddressText)
```

#### Serializing

Both `Ipv4` and `Ipv6` addresses have `Show` instances, which will serialize
these addresse to `Text` values.  IPv4 addresses will be serialized,
unsurprisingly, as four integers interspersed with `.` characters, and IPv6
addresses will be serialized according to the
[IETF's recommended canonical representation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5952),
which includes various simplifications.

### URLs

#### Construction

A URL instance can be defined using the `url""` interpolator, which will check
the URL's syntax at compiletime, reporting any parsing issues as compile errors. For example:
```scala
val url = url"https://github.com/propensive/nettlesom/"
```

It is also possible to construct a `Url` instance directly using the various
immutable datatypes from which it is composed, but it's rare that this would be
preferable.

#### Parsing

If the URL is not known at compiletime, but is available at runtime as a `Text`
string, it can be parsed. For example,
```scala
val url = Url.parse(urlText)
```

If an invalid value is passed to the `parse` method, then an error will be
raised. If using [Contingency](https://github.com/propensive/contingency/) then
there are a variety of ways in which such errors can be handled.






## Status

Urticose is classified as __maturescent__. For reference, Soundness projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, can still be used,
as long as caution is taken to avoid a mismatch between the project's stability
level and the required stability and maintainability of your own project.

Urticose is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 1160 lines of code.

## Building

Urticose will ultimately be built by Fury, when it is published. In the
meantime, two possibilities are offered, however they are acknowledged to be
fragile, inadequately tested, and unsuitable for anything more than
experimentation. They are provided only for the necessity of providing _some_
answer to the question, "how can I try Urticose?".

1. *Copy the sources into your own project*

   Read the `fury` file in the repository root to understand Urticose's build
   structure, dependencies and source location; the file format should be short
   and quite intuitive. Copy the sources into a source directory in your own
   project, then repeat (recursively) for each of the dependencies.

   The sources are compiled against the latest nightly release of Scala 3.
   There should be no problem to compile the project together with all of its
   dependencies in a single compilation.

2. *Build with [Wrath](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/)*

   Wrath is a bootstrapping script for building Urticose and other projects in
   the absence of a fully-featured build tool. It is designed to read the `fury`
   file in the project directory, and produce a collection of JAR files which can
   be added to a classpath, by compiling the project and all of its dependencies,
   including the Scala compiler itself.

   Download the latest version of
   [`wrath`](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/releases/latest), make it
   executable, and add it to your path, for example by copying it to
   `/usr/local/bin/`.

   Clone this repository inside an empty directory, so that the build can
   safely make clones of repositories it depends on as _peers_ of `urticose`.
   Run `wrath -F` in the repository root. This will download and compile the
   latest version of Scala, as well as all of Urticose's dependencies.

   If the build was successful, the compiled JAR files can be found in the
   `.wrath/dist` directory.

## Contributing

Contributors to Urticose are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like
to look for issues marked
[beginner](https://github.com/propensive/urticose/labels/beginner).

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing
Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of contributing to Urticose
easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Author

Urticose was designed and developed by Jon Pretty, and commercial support and
training on all aspects of Scala 3 is available from [Propensive
O&Uuml;](https://propensive.com/).



## Name

_Urticose_ means the abundance or resemblance of _nettles_, the stinging weeds
that share their first three letters with _network_, which is the subject of the
facilities provided by Urticose.

In general, Soundness project names are always chosen with some rationale,
however it is usually frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its
_uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or catchiness, and there is no
bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the libraries
perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it
should be noted how willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally
of Greek or Latin origin, and have often arrived in English via a romance
language.
