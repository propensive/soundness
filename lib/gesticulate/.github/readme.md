# Gesticulate

__Safe representations of MIME types__

_Gesticulate_ provides a structural representation of media types (previously known as MIME types),
representing their main type (e.g. `image`), subtype (e.g. `png`), suffixes (e.g. `+xml`) and
parameters (e.g. `charset=UTF-8`). It endorses the philosophy that impossible states should be
unrepresentable, which is contravened when media types are represented by strings.

## Features

- statically-checked representations of Media Types (a.k.a. MIME types)
- uses a `media""` string interpolator, e.g. `media"text/plain"`
- checks media types against the official IANA list at compiletime
- supports arbitrary custom `x-`-, `vnd.`- and `prs.`-prefixed types
- checks main media type (e.g. `text` or `image`), and suffixes (e.g. `+gzip` or `+json`)
- supports media type parameters such as `charset=UTF-8`


## Availability







## Getting Started

### `Medium`

All terms and types are defined in the `gesticulate` package:
```scala
import gesticulate.*
```

Gesticulate primarily provides the `Medium` type, consisting of:
 - a main "type" (called `group` to avoid a conflict with Scala's `type` keyword)
 - a subtype
 - a list of suffixes
 - a list of parameters, as key/value pairs

According to [RFC2046](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc2046), the main type must be one of an
enumerable list of ten types: `application`, `audio`, `image`, `message`, `multipart`, `text`,
`video`, `font`, `example` and `model`. These names are encoded (with capitalized initial letters)
in the enumeration, `Media.Group`.

The subtype may be a standard subtype, from IANA's [registered
list](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml), a vendor-specific subtype
(prefixed with `vnd.`) a "personal" subtype (prefixed with `prs.`) or a subtype prefixed with
`x.` or `x-`. The `Media.Subtype` enumeration distinguishes between these four categories.

Zero, one or more suffixes are allowed on any media type, of which 15 possibilities are currently
defined, including the common suffixes, `+xml`, `+json` and `+gzip`. These are enumerated in
`Media.Suffix`.

Parameters may be any key/value pair, and are represented as a `List[(String, String)]`, although
`charset` is the most common example.

The media type for XHTML, encoded as `UTF-8`, which would normally be written as
`application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8` may be represented as the case class instance,
```scala
import gossamer.t

val medium = Medium(
  group = Media.Group.Application,
  subtype = Media.Subtype.Standard(t"xhtml"),
  suffixes = List(Media.Suffix.Xml),
  parameters = List(t"charset" -> t"UTF-8")
)
```

However, this may be expressed as, `media"application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8"`, and Gesticulate
will statically parse, check and destructure the type into the `Medium` instance above.

`Medium` reimplements `toString` to render a media type as a `String`, and additionally provides
the method `basic` to provide the media type with any parameters removed. This may be useful in
some comparisons.

### Checking Registered Types

Media types are checked against a recent copy of IANA's list of registered types, generated from the
lists [published online](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml), and
stored on the classpath at `/gesticulate/media.types`. This file is distributed with each published
release of Gesticulate, but may be supplanted by an alternative list appearing in the classpath. The
format for the file is a newline delimited list of media types including suffixes, but excluding
parameters.

### Parsing

Media types may be parsed using `Medium.parse(string)` which returns a `Medium` or throws an
`InvalidMediumError`. The `InvalidMediumError.Nature` type encodes different varieties of
parsing failure, should it be useful to distinguish between these.





## Status

Gesticulate is classified as __maturescent__. For reference, Soundness projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, can still be used,
as long as caution is taken to avoid a mismatch between the project's stability
level and the required stability and maintainability of your own project.

Gesticulate is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 451 lines of code.

## Building

Gesticulate will ultimately be built by Fury, when it is published. In the
meantime, two possibilities are offered, however they are acknowledged to be
fragile, inadequately tested, and unsuitable for anything more than
experimentation. They are provided only for the necessity of providing _some_
answer to the question, "how can I try Gesticulate?".

1. *Copy the sources into your own project*

   Read the `fury` file in the repository root to understand Gesticulate's build
   structure, dependencies and source location; the file format should be short
   and quite intuitive. Copy the sources into a source directory in your own
   project, then repeat (recursively) for each of the dependencies.

   The sources are compiled against the latest nightly release of Scala 3.
   There should be no problem to compile the project together with all of its
   dependencies in a single compilation.

2. *Build with [Wrath](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/)*

   Wrath is a bootstrapping script for building Gesticulate and other projects in
   the absence of a fully-featured build tool. It is designed to read the `fury`
   file in the project directory, and produce a collection of JAR files which can
   be added to a classpath, by compiling the project and all of its dependencies,
   including the Scala compiler itself.

   Download the latest version of
   [`wrath`](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/releases/latest), make it
   executable, and add it to your path, for example by copying it to
   `/usr/local/bin/`.

   Clone this repository inside an empty directory, so that the build can
   safely make clones of repositories it depends on as _peers_ of `gesticulate`.
   Run `wrath -F` in the repository root. This will download and compile the
   latest version of Scala, as well as all of Gesticulate's dependencies.

   If the build was successful, the compiled JAR files can be found in the
   `.wrath/dist` directory.

## Contributing

Contributors to Gesticulate are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like
to look for issues marked
[beginner](https://github.com/propensive/gesticulate/labels/beginner).

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing
Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of contributing to Gesticulate
easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Author

Gesticulate was designed and developed by Jon Pretty, and commercial support and
training on all aspects of Scala 3 is available from [Propensive

## Name

Since _Gesticulate_ provides a representation for MIME types, it's appropriate that miming involves gesticulation.

In general, Soundness project names are always chosen with some rationale,
however it is usually frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its
_uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or catchiness, and there is no
bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the libraries
perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it
should be noted how willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally
of Greek or Latin origin, and have often arrived in English via a romance
language.

## Logo

The logo shows a simple fast-forward symbol, familiar from playing many kinds of media, since _media types_ are the subject of Gesticulate.
