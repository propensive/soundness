// is known, with its `Extent` in context); a `Branch` splits its space among
// children along an `Axis`. A pane projects to a pure `Frame` for solving (via
// `frame`) and yields its leaves in order (via `leaves`), so a solved
// `Placement`'s cells line up one-to-one with the leaves.
// A pane tree is pure: a `Leaf`'s deferred `content` is a *pure* function of its `Extent` (an
// `Extent` is itself the `Stdio`/`Canvas` it renders into, so content only uses what it is given and
// captures nothing ambient), so panes can be freely collected and traversed under capture checking.
