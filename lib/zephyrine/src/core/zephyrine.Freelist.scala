// path that lets a `Conduit`'s reader hand a drained block back to its writer
// for reuse instead of dropping it to the collector while the writer mints a
// fresh (zero-filled) replacement. Exactly one thread offers (the reader) and
// exactly one polls (the writer) — the same discipline the endpoints already
// enforce for the forward `Handoff`.
//
// Unlike `Handoff`, neither side ever blocks: this is a best-effort cache, not
// a rendezvous. A `poll` on an empty pool returns `null` (the writer allocates
// instead) and an `offer` to a full pool discards the block (the collector
// reclaims it). So the writer can never stall on an empty pool — which would
// deadlock against a reader parked waiting for that same writer — and the
// reader never stalls returning a block.
//
// A `SharedCapability`, like `Handoff`: the block ownership transfer is
// discharged by the ring's volatile publication order (a returned block is one
// the reader has finished reading and released), not by aliasing analysis.
