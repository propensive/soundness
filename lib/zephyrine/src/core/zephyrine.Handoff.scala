// A bounded single-producer/single-consumer hand-off ring: the exchange
// mechanism behind `Conduit` and the fan-out subscriber queues. Exactly one
// thread may call the producer operations (`offer`, `finish`) and exactly one
// the consumer operations (`take`, `close`) — the discipline the owning
// endpoints already enforce.
//
// Unlike a lock-based queue, both sides spin briefly (`Thread.onSpinWait`)
// before parking, so a producer and consumer in lockstep exchange items
// without kernel transitions — the dominant cost of a blocking hand-off. The
// unpark handshake is the standard Dekker pattern: each side publishes its
// index (a volatile write) before reading the other's waiting flag, and sets
// its waiting flag before re-checking the index, so a wakeup can never be
// missed.
//
// A `SharedCapability`: like `Conduit`'s core, its guarantees come from
// volatile publication order, not aliasing analysis.
