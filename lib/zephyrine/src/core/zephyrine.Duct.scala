// A synchronous transformation stage, attachable to either end of a pipeline:
// `stream.via(duct)` yields a differently-typed `Stream`, and
// `intake.accepting(duct)` yields a differently-typed `Intake` — the same
// `Duct` instance serves both, since `translate` converts demand whichever
// direction it is reported.
//
// `translate` is the demand-conversion hook: it maps downstream demand (in
// `out` terms) to upstream demand (in `in` terms), e.g. a bytes-to-hex duct
// maps a credit of 1024 chars to a credit of 512 bytes. Conversions must be
// conservative bounds, not exact arithmetic: any surplus a stage produces is
// retained in its buffer for the next transfer, which is what makes ducts
// with unknowable ratios (compression) possible.
//
// `step` is a pure buffer-to-buffer transformation. Given at least one input
// element and at least `quantum` elements of output space, it must consume or
// produce at least one element; input that cannot yet be transformed (a
// partial atom at the end of the offered input) must be consumed and carried
// in the duct's internal state, never left unconsumed across steps. A duct is
// single-owner mutable state: it belongs to the one thread driving its side
// of the pipeline.
