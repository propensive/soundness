_Villainy_ makes it possible to construct safe record types from a JSON Schema,
without any explicit Scala definitions of those types. This makes it safer and
easier to work with JSON values that conform to a schema. Record types are
generated by [Polyvinyl](https://github.com/propensive/polyvinyl) and JSON
integration is provided by [Jacinta](https://github.com/propensive/jacinta)
