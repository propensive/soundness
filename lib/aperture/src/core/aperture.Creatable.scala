// An entity which can be created: the counterpart of `Openable`, for bringing artifacts into
// existence rather than accessing existing ones. An instance is written
// `target is Creatable in Form by Flag to Handle`, and serves two notions of creation with
// one verb:
//
//  - *instantiation*: `path.create[Directory]()` makes an empty artifact exist, with no
//    scope, returning the target;
//  - *scoped authoring*: `path.create[Tar](): tar ?=> ...` creates the artifact, populates
//    it through a handle granted `Grants` (write access from birth: a newborn artifact is
//    unconditionally its creator's), and commits the result when the scope closes. An
//    exception escaping the scope means nothing is left behind: instances guarantee this by
//    staging to a temporary sibling and moving atomically, or by wiping what they created.
//
// There is no `Mode` parameter: what a creation scope may do is not a caller's choice, and
// the persisted permissions of the created entry are flag territory. Creating an entity that
// might already exist is governed by per-form flags (replacement is never the default), and
// is distinct from *opening* a possibly-absent entity for writing (`OpenFlag.Create`), which
// accesses whatever is there.

  // costs nothing; forms holding OS resources override it to create directly — notably a
  // FIFO, which must never be opened just to be created (opening one for writing blocks
  // until a reader appears).
