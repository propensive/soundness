# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to report a security issue in Soundness. I
appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with you to resolve problems
quickly.

## Supported Versions

Please report vulnerabilities which appear in the **latest release**.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability, please **email me directly** at:

**jon.pretty@propensive.com**

When reporting, please include:

- **a description of the issue**, in particular, what behaviour you observed and how this contrasted
  with your expectations;
- **steps to reproduce the problem**, preferably a minimal example;
- **the tagged version or commit hash** where the issue was found;
- **your assessment of the severity**, (low / moderate / high / critical)


## Disclosure Process

After receiving your report, I will:

1. **acknowledge receipt privately** as soon as reasonably possible, usually within 72 hours;
2. **evaluate the issue** to confirm its validity;
3. **work on a fix** or mitigation;
4. **coordinate a release** that includes the fix (usually the next weekly release);
5. **thank you publicly** (unless otherwise requested) once the issue is resolved.


## Public Disclosure

Please **do not publicly disclose the vulnerability** until a fix has been released.  
If the issue is particularly severe, I may request additional time for a coordinated release.

If you believe I am unresponsive or taking excessive time, you can contact me via other means, on
[X](https://x.com/propensive) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MBUrkTgMnA).
