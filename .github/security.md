# Security Policy

Reporting of security issues in Soundness is welcome, encouraged and
appreciated. The maintainers are grateful for responsible disclosure of
vulnerabilities relating to the **latest release** and will work with you to
resolve them quickly.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability, please **email the
maintainers directly** at:

**jon.pretty@propensive.com**

When reporting, please include:

- **a description of the issue**, in particular, what behaviour you observed and
  how it did not meet your expectations;
- **steps to reproduce the problem**, preferably with a minimized example;
- and preferably, **the tagged version or commit hash** where the issue was
  found.


## Disclosure Process

After receiving your report, the maintainers will:

1. **acknowledge receipt privately** as soon as reasonably possible, usually
   within 72 hours; 2. **evaluate the issue** to confirm its validity;
3. **work on a fix** or mitigation;
4. **coordinate a release** including the fix, usually the next weekly release;
5. **thank you publicly** (unless otherwise requested) once the issue is resolved.


## Public Disclosure

Please **do not publicly disclose the vulnerability** until a fix has been
released. If the issue is particularly severe, additional time may be requested
for a coordinated release.

If you do not receive a timely response, you can make contact via other means, such as
[X](https://x.com/propensive) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MBUrkTgMnA).
