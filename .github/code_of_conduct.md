## Conduct

Contributors and other participants in online discussions are expected to be
civil, on-topic and to nurture a pleasant development environment for all
Soundness&rsquo;s users. Individualism is valued, and nobody should feel
constrained in how they express themselves, as long as they adhere to these
expectations.

Propensive O&Uuml; have some powers to address conduct issues, but that will
start with an informal conversation, and without prejudice.
