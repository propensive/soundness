# Code of Conduct

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all official spaces associated with the
Soundness project, including the propensive/soundness GitHub repository
(encompassing issues, pull requests, discussions, and all related interactions)
and the Soundness Discord channel.

Its purpose is to ensure that these spaces remain productive, civil, and centred
on technical collaboration. All participants, whether maintainers, contributors,
or visitors, are expected to follow these principles when engaging in any
project-related communication.


## Focus

Project discussions must remain centred on the technical subject matter of
Soundness.

Contributors should direct their comments toward the project’s
codebase, design decisions, documentation, or other clearly relevant technical
topics. Material that is tangential, personal, or unrelated to the project’s
goals may be redirected or closed by the maintainers in order to preserve
clarity and usefulness in project channels.


## Conduct Toward Individuals

Participants must address ideas rather than the individuals responsible for them.

Critique of technical decisions is welcome, but commentary on a contributor’s
character, motives, competence, or personal attributes is not. Except where
strictly factual, necessary, and objective, statements about other contributors
fall outside the bounds of acceptable discussion. Contributions should refer
only to the content under discussion and not to personal aspects of those
involved.


## Authority

The maintainers of the project retain full authority to interpret and enforce
this Code of Conduct. They may edit, hide, lock, or remove content, and may
restrict or revoke participation in project spaces where necessary to maintain a
constructive environment. This authority will be exercised sparingly and without
prejudice, with the aim of preserving focus on the project and protecting
contributors from personal attacks or persistent disruption. Maintainer
decisions are final and are not subject to debate within project channels.


## Reporting Concerns

Concerns regarding potential violations of this Code of Conduct may be raised
privately by contacting the project maintainers at
[jon.pretty@propensive.com](mailto:jon.pretty@propensive.com). Reports will be
handled respectfully and at the discretion of the maintainers, consistent
with the principles above.
