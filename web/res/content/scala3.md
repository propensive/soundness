### Next Generation Scala

Soundness was developed natively for Scala 3, and exploits its extensive new features to the limit. Its sound typesystem and powerful metaprogramming capabilities make it uniquely able to accommodate APIs that take full advantage of precise types without compromising your code's legibility.

Soundness is evolved from the experience of Scala 2, but not held back by its legacy. No interface has been compromised in its expressiveness for compatibility with Scala 2. Adopting Soundness means a full-throated endorsement of the future of Scala.
