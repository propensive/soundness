### Declarative Programming

Declarative code is easier to reason about because it's independent of control flow. Its essential structure arises from scopes and contexts, and in Scala 3 it's possible with _contextual_ values. Declare a new given instance or import an existing one, and it's valid for the entire scope. And you decide whether that's just a method body, or your entire project—on a continuuum between local and global. There's less repetition, and your code is more maintainable.
