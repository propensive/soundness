### Two Golden Principles

At the foundation of Soundness lie two core principles: Impossible states should be unrepresentable, and transitions between states should be total. Together, they ensure that your program starts in a correct state and never leaves it. That means no unexpected runtime errors.

Every library in the Soundness ecosystem is built on these principles, and coerces your code along the path of correctness.
