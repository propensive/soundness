# Probably



## Features

TBC


## Getting Started

TBC


## Status

Probably is classified as __fledgling__. Propensive defines the following five stability levels for open-source projects:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without guarantee of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement of designs
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

## Availability

Probably&rsquo;s source is available on GitHub, and may be built with [Fury](https://github.com/propensive/fury) by
cloning the layer `propensive/euphemism`.
```
fury layer clone -i propensive/euphemism
```
or imported into an existing layer with,
```
fury layer import -i propensive/euphemism
```
A binary is available on Maven Central as `com.propensive:euphemism-core_<scala-version>:0.8.0`. This may be added
to an [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) build with:
```
libraryDependencies += "com.propensive" %% "euphemism-core" % "0.8.0"
```
